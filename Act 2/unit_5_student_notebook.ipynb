    "### 1. What was your agent's worst loss (greatest point differential) and why?\n",
    "My agent's greatest loss was against Always Undercut. It lost 73 to 208 (a 135-point difference). Always Undercut defects every single round, meaning its cooperation rate is always 0%. In my agent’s logic, when the opponent’s cooperation rate drops below 50%, it retaliates with probability Gene[2]. This allowed Always Undercut to exploit my cooperation every time it occurred, which created a large point difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What pattern do you see in wins vs. losses?\n",
    "\n",
    "My agent performs well against cooporative agents. These opponents maintain cooperation rates above 50%, which triggers my agent’s Gene[1] (cooperation response). My agent struggles against aggressive or strategically reactive agents like Always Undercut, Hard Majority, and Suspicious Tit-for-Tat.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What would make an agent more competitive?\n",
    "\n",
    "To make my agent more competitive I would make it respond more agressivly to constant defection from the opponent. I would make it so that it would always undercut after a certain amount of repeated undercuts and then I would only stop undercutting if they stopped. \n",
    "\n",

    "- What was your agent's final tournament rank? 6 out of 19\n",
    "- What was your agent's total score? 4,675\n",
    "- Look at agents that ranked above and below you - what strategies do they use? \n",
    "    - They tend to be cooperative or sophisticated agents, which is interesting because my first agent only seemed to lose to non coperative agents, which I think is becuse my agent was too forgiving. But now I am losing to the ones that are more forgiving to me, so I probably need to find a better middle ground of cooperativeness.\n",

    "### 3. Strategy Analysis\n",
    "Look at your evolved genes: ['1.00', '1.00', '0.37', '0.00', '0.18', '0.35']\n",
    "\n",
    "- In plain English, what strategy did your agent evolve?\n",
    "    - my agent starts nice and cooperates in the first rounds, which is the same as the original agent, but it evolved to 0 in the forgiveness gene and respondes very agressivly once it decides you are agressive. \n",
    "- Does it cooperate with cooperators? Does it punish defectors?\n",
    "    - It does cooperate with cooperators and it responds strongluy to defectors. \n",
    "- Why do you think evolution discovered this particular strategy?\n",
    "    - I think it discoveded this strategy because originally it was losing to agents for being too forgiving so it had to learn to be less forgiving. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Trade-offs\n",
    "Every strategy has strengths and weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which types of opponents does your agent beat?\n",
    "    - My agent seems like it mostly beats non cooperative agents, which I think is because my agent retaliates harshly to agents that undercut a lot.\n",
    "- Which types beat your agent?\n",
    "    - It appears to lost most often to cooperative or sophisticated agents, which I think is becuse my agent was too forgiving originaly.\n",
    "- If you could redesign your agent for Unit 6, what would you change?\n",
    "    - I would try to find a better middle groud where it keeps its harsh responses to agents who undercut a lot, but is more forgiving to those who change their ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. The Environment Matters\n",
    "- You evolved against a random sample of 10 opponents\n",
    "- The tournament included all 19 opponents\n",
    "- Unit 6 will include 30+ student agents with unpredictable strategies\n",
    "- How might your agent perform in that different environment?\n",
    "    - If I face 30+ oponents all of whom are an agent type that my agent struggles with, then I may do much worse. "
