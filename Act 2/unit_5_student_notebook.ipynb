    "\n",
    "### 1. What was your agent's worst loss (greatest point differential) and why?\n",
    "My agent's greatest loss was against Always Undercut. It lost 73 to 208 (a 135-point difference). Always Undercut defects every single round, meaning its cooperation rate is always 0%. In my agent’s logic, when the opponent’s cooperation rate drops below 50%, it retaliates with probability Gene[2]. This allowed Always Undercut to exploit my cooperation every time it occurred, which created a large point difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What pattern do you see in wins vs. losses?\n",
    "\n",
    "My agent performs well against cooporative agents. These opponents maintain cooperation rates above 50%, which triggers my agent’s Gene[1] (cooperation response). My agent struggles against aggressive or strategically reactive agents like Always Undercut, Hard Majority, and Suspicious Tit-for-Tat.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What would make an agent more competitive?\n",
    "\n",
    "To make my agent more competitive I would make it respond more agressivly to constant defection from the opponent. I would make it so that it would always undercut after a certain amount of repeated undercuts and then I would only stop undercutting if they stopped. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "\n",

    "- The tournament included all 19 opponents\n",
    "- Unit 6 will include 30+ student agents with unpredictable strategies\n",
